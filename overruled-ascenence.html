Underneath the city is a large amount of caverns where miners, deployed by the corporation, slave away to gather resources which only benefits the corporation and not those inside of the city. The corporation promises the resources are going towards the “Betterment of humankind” the real purpose is uncontested overruling of the whole planet.

They defend their territory and make it difficult for the miners, they are extremely dangerous and are exploited by the corporation.
